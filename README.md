# Basic JavaScript Example

This project consists of the following Basic JS examples:

A) **Undefined Vs Not Defined**: This topic dives into the nuances between a variable being declared but not assigned a value (resulting in `undefined`) and a variable not being declared at all (`not defined`). Understanding this difference is crucial for debugging and writing clean code.

B) **Passing Function as an argument**: Explains the behavior of passing functions as arguments to other functions and what happens when you print the function itself. This concept is essential for understanding higher-order functions and functional programming paradigms in JavaScript.

C) **Hoisting**: Explores the fascinating concept of hoisting in JavaScript, where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase. This allows variables to be accessed before they are formally declared in the code, but it's essential to understand its implications to avoid unexpected behavior.

D) **How functions work?**: Provides a comprehensive overview of how functions operate in JavaScript, including function declaration, expression, invocation, and the mechanics of returning values. Understanding these fundamental concepts lays the groundwork for effectively using functions in JavaScript applications.

E) **Lexical Environment => Local Memory and reference to Lexical Environment of the parent**: Delves into the concept of lexical environments, which encompass the local memory of a function execution context and its reference to the lexical environment of its parent scope. This understanding is crucial for comprehending variable scoping and closures in JavaScript.

F) **Promises**: Explores promises as a powerful abstraction for handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript. A promise represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and allows for more manageable and readable asynchronous code compared to traditional callback-based approaches.

G) **Async Await**: Introduces the `async/await` syntax, which provides a more synchronous-like way to write asynchronous code in JavaScript. `async` functions return a promise, and the `await` keyword is used within `async` functions to pause execution until a promise is resolved or rejected, leading to cleaner and more expressive asynchronous code.
